# Mission-to-Mars

The purpose of this project was to build a web application that scrapes new data every time someone tells it to with the click of a button.
- For the project I used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, lates Mars's news and the new's description. Also, scrape data held in a table format using Pandas. 
- The scraped data was stored on a Mongo database and Flask web application was used to display the data. Finally, used Bootstrap to alter the design of the web app to accommodate all the elements and data.
